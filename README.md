## Description:
This project is a simple 3D game implemented in Python using the ModernGL library for OpenGL rendering. It creates a game environment where the player controls a spaceship to shoot down enemy objects while avoiding collisions. The game features a grid-based play area with dynamically moving enemies, bullets, and particle effects.

## Key Features:
 - **Player Control**: The player can move the spaceship in a 3D environment using arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar.
 - **Dynamic Enemy Movement**: Enemies move across the grid in a predefined pattern, providing a dynamic gameplay experience.
 - **Collision Detection**: The game detects collisions between the player's spaceship, bullets, and enemy objects, triggering appropriate actions such as destroying enemies or ending the game.
 - **Audio Effects**: Sound effects are integrated into the game for actions such as shooting bullets and collisions.
 - **Visual Effects**: The game features dynamic particle effects triggered by enemy destruction, accompanied by the implementation of Phong shading for enhanced lighting realism.

## Technologies Used:
 - **Python**: The core programming language used for implementing game logic and rendering.
 - **ModernGL**: A Python wrapper for OpenGL, utilized for efficient rendering of 3D graphics.
 - **Pygame**: Used for audio playback functionality within the game.
 - **NumPy**: Used for numerical computations and array operations.
 - **_main**: Custom module for setting up the game scene and initializing resources.
 - **Shaders**: Custom shaders written in GLSL for rendering various game objects with lighting effects.

## How to Run:
To run the game, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries mentioned above. Then, execute the provided Python script (main.py) in your preferred Python environment.

## Future Enhancements: 
 - Implement additional levels with increasing difficulty.
 - Implement the ability for enemies to shoot bullets.
 - Add power-ups and other interactive elements to enhance gameplay.
 - Improve graphics and visual effects for a more immersive experience.

Have fun experimenting with the game!
